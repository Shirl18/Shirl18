Front-end:
  •	A basic user interface that is bright and easy to see and read so that there isn’t any confusion and information is readable and clear.
Back-end: 
  •	Program language will be Java. 
  •	A TinyDB is used for storage to allow for a more security for company information. 
  •	User authentication for Admin users

Be_Informed is an offline bulletin plus instant messenger and more.  The first interaction with the app will require a one-time sign-in and will never sign you out unless you want to sign out.  When you want to post an announcement for everyone to see, you’ll have a big display where your message or announcement will appear. If you need to send a message to an individual, IM is available by accessing the contacts in your phone you can send a direct message to you managers and supervisors. Likewise, your managers and supervisors will be able to IM back and forth with employees that work directly under them. Be_Informed can be personalized for your company allowing you to upload any announcements, forms, pictures, or contacts attached to the following named buttons. These items will be added using direct uploads from a computer, mobile phone, or laptop to the app using the admin button and easy to use and set up.

A two-dimensional illustration of a page's interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors. Each menu button will have a clean user interface that includes instructions.  The buttons will be large with large text so that they are easily identified.  The announcement section will display and save current information until you press on it to remove any announcements.  The homepage would display the company’s name, announcement, and buttons to move you into different sections of the app.
